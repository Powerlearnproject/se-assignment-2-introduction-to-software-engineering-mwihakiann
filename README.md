# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality software systems. It involves the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software programs.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Software engineering is the application of engineering principles, tools, and methods to the development and maintenance of high quality software systems. It encompasses a broader scope compared to traditional programming, for instance, project management and quality assuarance. Traditional programming primarily focuses on writing code to implement specific functionalities. Software engineering involves holistic approach to ensure the software is reliable, maintainable, and meets user requirements.
Software Development Life Cycle ia a structured process that enables the production of high quality, low-cost software, in the shortest possible production time.It consist of several phases, planning and analysis, define requirements, design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance.

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.

planning and analysis- this is the project planning phase. It is where one gathers business requirements from your client or stakeholders.The feasibility of creating the product is evaluated.
Define requirements- in this phase the information gathered during the planning stage is converted into clear requirements for the development team. This process guides the development of several important documents such as software requirement specification.
implementation-involves actual coding and development of the software based on the design documents.
testing- systematically finding and fixing bugs to ensure the software functions correctly and meets the requirements.
deployment-releasing the software to a live environment where it becomes accessible to end-users.
maintenance-ongoing support and updates to the software to fix issues, add new features, and ensure continued operation.

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?

Agile develops software in small, incremental cycles and it is flexible hence allows changes and adaptation throughout the development process. Continous interaction with customers for feedback and improvements. Preferred projects with dynamic requirements, need for rapid delivery, and close collaboration with stakeholders.
waterfall model follows a linear and sequential approach with distint phases. it is difficult to make changes once the phase is completed.Heavy reliance on documentation at each stage. Preferrable for projects with well-defined requirements and a clear understanding of the final product.

Requirements Engineering:
What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.

Requirement Engineering is the discipline that involves establishing and documenting requirements. It includes requirements elicitation, analysis, specification, validation, and management. The process is crucial as it ensures that the final software product meets the needs and expectation of stakeholders, reducing the risk of project failure.

Software Design Principles:
Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?

Modularity in software design is a technique where complex software is divided into smaller, independent modules such as classes. It facilitates easier management and understanding of complex sysytems by breaking them down into digestible parts.

Testing in Software Engineering:
Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?

Unit testing- testing individual components or functions for correctness.
intergration testing-testing the interaction between the intergrated components to ensure they work together.
system testing-testing the complete and intergrated software to verify it meets specified requirements.
acceptance testing- validating the software with the end-users to ensure it meets their needs and requirements.
Testing is crucial as it indentifies defects, ensures quality, and verifies that the software performs as expected.

Version Control Systems:
What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.

Version control systems are tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. They facilitate coordination, sharing and collaboration across the entire software development team.
for example git, it facilitates branching, merging, and distributed repositories.

Software Project Management:
Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?

A Software project manager oversee the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects. 
The key responsibilities include: project planning, team management, risk management and quality assurance. Some of challenges faced in managing software projects are managing changing requirements, maintaining timelines, and balancing resources.

Software Maintenance:
Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?

Software maintenance involves updating and improving software after its initial deployment. Types of maintenance activities include:
Adaptive maintenance-updating the software to work in new or changing environment.
Correction maintenance-fixing bugs and defects
Perfective maintenance-enhancing performance or adding new features
preventive maintenance-making changes to prevent
Maintenance is essential to ensure the software remains functional, secure, and relevant over time.

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:
What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?

Ethical issues in software engineering include data privacy, intellectual property rights, and the potential impact of software on society. Software engineers must adhere to ethical standard by:
Ensuring data privacy-protecting user data and confidentiality.
Respecting intellectual property-acknowledging and respecting the intellectual property of others.
Considering social impact-assessing and mitigating the negative impact of software on users and society.
